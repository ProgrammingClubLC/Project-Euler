* Use whatever language you like

* Practice good teamwork - brainstorm, make use of the whiteboard, and organize your ideas before starting to code.

* List all the names of your teammates on the code you post - give credit where credit is due!

* Try to write nice code - lots of comments, practical function/variable names.

* Ideally try to optimize code for speed - code for every problem should take less than a minute to run.
